      "delicately made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent\n",
      "\n",
      "crystalline substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that\n",
      "\n",
      "follows--unless his explanation is to be accepted--is an absolutely\n",
      "\n",
      "unaccountable thing. He took one of the small octagonal tables that\n",
      "\n",
      "were scattered about the room, and set it in front of the fire, with\n",
      "\n",
      "two legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed the mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other object on the\n",
      "\n",
      "table was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell upon\n",
      "\n",
      "the model. There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in\n",
      "\n",
      "brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that\n",
      "\n",
      "the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair\n",
      "\n",
      "nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between\n",
      "\n",
      "the Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat behind him, looking\n",
      "\n",
      "over his shoulder. The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor watched\n",
      "\n",
      "him in profile from the right, the Psychologist from the left. The\n",
      "\n",
      "Very Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. We were all on the\n",
      "\n",
      "alert. It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however\n",
      "\n",
      "subtly conceived and however adroitly done, could have been played\n",
      "\n",
      "upon us under these conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. 'Well?'\n",
      "\n",
      "said the Psychologist.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'This little affair,' said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows\n",
      "\n",
      "upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus,\n",
      "\n",
      "'is only a model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through\n",
      "\n",
      "time. You will notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there\n",
      "\n",
      "is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in\n",
      "\n",
      "some way unreal.' He pointed to the part with his finger. 'Also,\n",
      "\n",
      "here is one little white lever, and here is another.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's beautifully made,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'It took two years to make,' retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when\n",
      "\n",
      "we had all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: 'Now I\n",
      "\n",
      "want you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over,\n",
      "\n",
      "sends the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses\n",
      "\n",
      "the motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently I am going to press the lever, and off the machine will\n",
      "\n",
      "go. It will vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a\n",
      "\n",
      "good look at the thing. Look at the table too, and satisfy\n",
      "\n",
      "yourselves there is no trickery. I don't want to waste this model,\n",
      "\n",
      "and then be told I'm a quack.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a minute's pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to\n",
      "\n",
      "speak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth\n",
      "\n",
      "his finger towards the lever. 'No,' he said suddenly. 'Lend me your\n",
      "\n",
      "hand.' And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual's\n",
      "\n",
      "hand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it\n",
      "\n",
      "was the Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine\n",
      "\n",
      "on its interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am\n",
      "\n",
      "absolutely certain there was no trickery. There was a breath of\n",
      "\n",
      "wind, and the lamp flame jumped. One of the candles on the mantel\n",
      "\n",
      "was blown out, and the little machine suddenly swung round, became\n",
      "\n",
      "indistinct, was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps, as an eddy of\n",
      "\n",
      "faintly glittering brass and ivory; and it was gone--vanished! Save\n",
      "\n",
      "for the lamp the table was bare.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked\n",
      "\n",
      "under the table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well?' he said, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then,\n",
      "\n",
      "getting up, he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his\n",
      "\n",
      "back to us began to fill his pipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stared at each other. 'Look here,' said the Medical Man, 'are you\n",
      "\n",
      "in earnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine\n",
      "\n",
      "has travelled into time?'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Certainly,' said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at\n",
      "\n",
      "the fire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the\n",
      "\n",
      "Psychologist's face. (The Psychologist, to show that he was not\n",
      "\n",
      "unhinged, helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.)\n",
      "\n",
      "'What is more, I have a big machine nearly finished in there'--he\n",
      "\n",
      "indicated the laboratory--'and when that is put together I mean to\n",
      "\n",
      "have a journey on my own account.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?'\n",
      "\n",
      "said Filby.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Into the future or the past--I don't, for certain, know which.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. 'It must have\n",
      "\n",
      "gone into the past if it has gone anywhere,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why?' said the Time Traveller.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it\n",
      "\n",
      "travelled into the future it would still be here all this time,\n",
      "\n",
      "since it must have travelled through this time.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'But,' I said, 'If it travelled into the past it would have been\n",
      "\n",
      "visible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when we\n",
      "\n",
      "were here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Serious objections,' remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air of\n",
      "\n",
      "impartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not a bit,' said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: 'You\n",
      "\n",
      "think. You can explain that. It's presentation below the threshold,\n",
      "\n",
      "you know, diluted presentation.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course,' said the Psychologist, and reassured us. 'That's a\n",
      "\n",
      "simple point of psychology. I should have thought of it. It's plain\n",
      "\n",
      "enough, and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor\n",
      "\n",
      "can we appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of\n",
      "\n",
      "a wheel spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is\n",
      "\n",
      "travelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than\n",
      "\n",
      "we are, if it gets through a minute while we get through a second,\n",
      "\n",
      "the impression it creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or\n",
      "\n",
      "one-hundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling in\n",
      "\n",
      "time. That's plain enough.' He passed his hand through the space in\n",
      "\n",
      "which the machine had been. 'You see?' he said, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the\n",
      "\n",
      "Time Traveller asked us what we thought of it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'It sounds plausible enough to-night,' said the Medical Man; 'but\n",
      "\n",
      "wait until to-morrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?' asked the Time\n",
      "\n",
      "Traveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the\n",
      "\n",
      "way down the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember\n",
      "\n",
      "vividly the flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette,\n",
      "\n",
      "the dance of the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but\n",
      "\n",
      "incredulous, and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger\n",
      "\n",
      "edition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before\n",
      "\n",
      "our eyes. Parts were of nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly\n",
      "\n",
      "been filed or sawn out of rock crystal. The thing was generally\n",
      "\n",
      "complete, but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the\n",
      "\n",
      "bench beside some sheets of drawings, and I took one up for a better\n",
      "\n",
      "look at it. Quartz it seemed to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Look here,' said the Medical Man, 'are you perfectly serious?\n",
      "\n",
      "Or is this a trick--like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Upon that machine,' said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp\n",
      "\n",
      "aloft, 'I intend to explore time. Is that plain? I was never more\n",
      "\n",
      "serious in my life.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "None of us quite knew how to take it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I caught Filby's eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and he\n",
      "\n",
      "winked at me solemnly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "II\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who\n",
      "\n",
      "are too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round\n",
      "\n",
      "him; you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in\n",
      "\n",
      "ambush, behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and\n",
      "\n",
      "explained the matter in the Time Traveller's words, we should have\n",
      "\n",
      "shown _him_ far less scepticism. For we should have perceived his\n",
      "\n",
      "motives; a pork butcher could understand Filby. But the Time\n",
      "\n",
      "Traveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements, and we\n",
      "\n",
      "distrusted him. Things that would have made the frame of a less\n",
      "\n",
      "clever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do things\n",
      "\n",
      "too easily. The serious people who took him seriously never felt\n",
      "\n",
      "quite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trusting\n",
      "\n",
      "their reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a\n",
      "\n",
      "nursery with egg-shell china. So I don't think any of us said very\n",
      "\n",
      "much about time travelling in the interval between that Thursday and\n",
      "\n",
      "the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of\n",
      "\n",
      "our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical incredibleness,\n",
      "\n",
      "the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it\n",
      "\n",
      "suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied with the\n",
      "\n",
      "trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the Medical Man,\n",
      "\n",
      "whom I met on Friday at the Linnaean. He said he had seen a similar\n",
      "\n",
      "thing at Tubingen, and laid considerable stress on the blowing out\n",
      "\n",
      "of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not explain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The next Thursday I went again to Richmond--I suppose I was one of\n",
      "\n",
      "the Time Traveller's most constant guests--and, arriving late, found\n",
      "\n",
      "four or five men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical\n",
      "\n",
      "Man was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand\n",
      "\n",
      "and his watch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller,\n",
      "\n",
      "and--'It's half-past seven now,' said the Medical Man. 'I suppose\n",
      "\n",
      "we'd better have dinner?'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Where's----?' said I, naming our host.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'You've just come? It's rather odd. He's unavoidably detained. He\n",
      "\n",
      "asks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he's not\n",
      "\n",
      "back. Says he'll explain when he comes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,' said the Editor of a\n",
      "\n",
      "well-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself\n",
      "\n",
      "who had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the\n",
      "\n",
      "Editor aforementioned, a certain journalist, and another--a quiet,\n",
      "\n",
      "shy man with a beard--whom I didn't know, and who, as far as my\n",
      "\n",
      "observation went, never opened his mouth all the evening. There was\n",
      "\n",
      "some speculation at the dinner-table about the Time Traveller's\n",
      "\n",
      "absence, and I suggested time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Editor wanted that explained to him, and the Psychologist\n",
      "\n",
      "volunteered a wooden account of the 'ingenious paradox and trick' we\n",
      "\n",
      "had witnessed that day week. He was in the midst of his exposition\n",
      "\n",
      "when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise. I\n",
      "\n",
      "was facing the door, and saw it first. 'Hallo!' I said. 'At last!'\n",
      "\n",
      "And the door opened wider, and the Time Traveller stood before us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I gave a cry of surprise. 'Good heavens! man, what's the matter?'\n",
      "\n",
      "cried the Medical Man, who saw him next. And the whole tableful\n",
      "\n",
      "turned towards the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and\n",
      "\n",
      "smeared with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it\n",
      "\n",
      "seemed to me greyer--either with dust and dirt or because its colour\n",
      "\n",
      "had actually faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown\n",
      "\n",
      "cut on it--a cut half healed; his expression was haggard and drawn,\n",
      "\n",
      "as by intense suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway,\n",
      "\n",
      "as if he had been dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked with just such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps.\n",
      "\n",
      "We stared at him in silence, expecting him to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a\n",
      "\n",
      "motion towards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and\n",
      "\n",
      "pushed it towards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good:\n",
      "\n",
      "for he looked round the table, and the ghost of his old smile\n",
      "\n",
      "flickered across his face. 'What on earth have you been up to, man?'\n",
      "\n",
      "said the Doctor. The Time Traveller did not seem to hear. 'Don't let\n",
      "\n",
      "me disturb you,' he said, with a certain faltering articulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm all right.' He stopped, held out his glass for more, and took\n",
      "\n",
      "it off at a draught. 'That's good,' he said. His eyes grew brighter,\n",
      "\n",
      "and a faint colour came into his cheeks. His glance flickered over\n",
      "\n",
      "our faces with a certain dull approval, and then went round the warm\n",
      "\n",
      "and comfortable room. Then he spoke again, still as it were feeling\n",
      "\n",
      "his way among his words. 'I'm going to wash and dress, and then I'll\n",
      "\n",
      "come down and explain things ... Save me some of that mutton. I'm\n",
      "\n",
      "starving for a bit of meat.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he\n",
      "\n",
      "was all right. The Editor began a question. 'Tell you presently,'\n",
      "\n",
      "said the Time Traveller. 'I'm--funny! Be all right in a minute.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again\n",
      "\n",
      "I remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall,\n",
      "\n",
      "and standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had\n",
      "\n",
      "nothing on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the\n",
      "\n",
      "door closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered\n",
      "\n",
      "how he detested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my\n",
      "\n",
      "mind was wool-gathering. Then, 'Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientist,' I heard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in\n",
      "\n",
      "headlines. And this brought my attention back to the bright\n",
      "\n",

      "'What's the game?' said the Journalist. 'Has he been doing the\n",
      "\n",
      "Amateur Cadger? I don't follow.' I met the eye of the Psychologist,\n",
      "\n",
      "and read my own interpretation in his face. I thought of the Time\n",
      "\n",
      "Traveller limping painfully upstairs. I don't think any one else had\n",
      "\n",
      "noticed his lameness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical\n",
      "\n",
      "Man, who rang the bell--the Time Traveller hated to have servants\n",
      "\n",
      "waiting at dinner--for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his\n",
      "\n",
      "knife and fork with a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The\n",
      "\n",
      "dinner was resumed. Conversation was exclamatory for a little while,\n",
      "\n",
      "with gaps of wonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his\n",
      "\n",
      "curiosity. 'Does our friend eke out his modest income with a\n",
      "\n",
      "crossing? or has he his Nebuchadnezzar phases?' he inquired. 'I feel\n",
      "\n",
      "assured it's this business of the Time Machine,' I said, and took up\n",
      "\n",
      "the Psychologist's account of our previous meeting. The new guests\n",
      "\n",
      "were frankly incredulous. The Editor raised objections. 'What _was_\n",
      "\n",
      "this time travelling? A man couldn't cover himself with dust by\n",
      "\n",
      "rolling in a paradox, could he?' And then, as the idea came home to\n",
      "\n",
      "him, he resorted to caricature. Hadn't they any clothes-brushes in\n",
      "\n",
      "the Future? The Journalist too, would not believe at any price, and\n",
      "\n",
      "joined the Editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole\n",
      "\n",
      "thing. They were both the new kind of journalist--very joyous,\n",
      "\n",
      "irreverent young men. 'Our Special Correspondent in the Day\n",
      "\n",
      "after To-morrow reports,' the Journalist was saying--or rather\n",
      "\n",
      "shouting--when the Time Traveller came back. He was dressed in\n",
      "\n",
      "ordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look remained\n",
      "\n",
      "of the change that had startled me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'I say,' said the Editor hilariously, 'these chaps here say you have\n",
      "\n",
      "been travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all about\n",
      "\n",
      "little Rosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a\n",
      "\n",
      "word. He smiled quietly, in his old way. 'Where's my mutton?' he\n",
      "\n",
      "said. 'What a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Story!' cried the Editor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Story be damned!' said the Time Traveller. 'I want something to\n",
      "\n",
      "eat. I won't say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks. And the salt.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his\n",
      "\n",
      "head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'd give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,' said the Editor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Time Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang\n",
      "\n",
      "it with his fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been\n",
      "\n",
      "staring at his face, started convulsively, and poured him wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the dinner was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden\n",
      "\n",
      "questions kept on rising to my lips, and I dare say it was the same\n",
      "\n",
      "with the others. The Journalist tried to relieve the tension by\n",
      "\n",
      "telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The Time Traveller devoted his\n",
      "\n",
      "attention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite of a tramp.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched the Time Traveller\n",
      "\n",
      "through his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even more clumsy than\n",
      "\n",
      "usual, and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of\n",
      "\n",
      "sheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller pushed his plate away,\n",
      "\n",
      "and looked round us. 'I suppose I must apologize,' he said. 'I was\n",
      "\n",
      "simply starving. I've had a most amazing time.' He reached out his\n",
      "\n",
      "hand for a cigar, and cut the end. 'But come into the smoking-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's too long a story to tell over greasy plates.' And ringing the\n",
      "\n",
      "bell in passing, he led the way into the adjoining room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?' he\n",
      "\n",
      "said to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new\n",
      "\n",
      "guests.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'But the thing's a mere paradox,' said the Editor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'I can't argue to-night. I don't mind telling you the story, but\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't argue. I will,' he went on, 'tell you the story of what\n",
      "\n",
      "has happened to me, if you like, but you must refrain from\n",
      "\n",
      "interruptions. I want to tell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like\n",
      "\n",
      "lying. So be it! It's true--every word of it, all the same. I was in\n",
      "\n",
      "my laboratory at four o'clock, and since then ... I've lived eight\n",
      "\n",
      "days ... such days as no human being ever lived before! I'm nearly\n",
      "\n",
      "worn out, but I shan't sleep till I've told this thing over to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I shall go to bed. But no interruptions! Is it agreed?'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Agreed,' said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed 'Agreed.' And\n",
      "\n",
      "with that the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Afterwards he got more animated. In writing it down I feel with only\n",
      "\n",
      "too much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink--and, above all, my\n",
      "\n",
      "own inadequacy--to express its quality. You read, I will suppose,\n",
      "\n",
      "attentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker's white,\n",
      "\n",
      "sincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the\n",
      "\n",
      "intonation of his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed\n",
      "\n",
      "the turns of his story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the\n",
      "\n",
      "candles in the smoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face\n",
      "\n",
      "of the Journalist and the legs of the Silent Man from the knees\n",
      "\n",
      "downward were illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at each\n",
      "\n",
      "other. After a time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the\n",
      "\n",
      "Time Traveller's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the\n",
      "\n",
      "workshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of\n",
      "\n",
      "the ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of\n",
      "\n",
      "it's sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday, but on Friday,\n",
      "\n",
      "when the putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the\n",
      "\n",
      "nickel bars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get\n",
      "\n",
      "remade; so that the thing was not complete until this morning. It\n",
      "\n",
      "was at ten o'clock to-day that the first of all Time Machines began\n",
      "\n",
      "its career. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put\n",
      "\n",
      "one more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the\n",
      "\n",
      "saddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels\n",
      "\n",
      "much the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then. I took\n",
      "\n",
      "the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other,\n",
      "\n",
      "pressed the first, and almost immediately the second. I seemed to\n",
      "\n",
      "reel; I felt a nightmare sensation of falling; and, looking round,\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw the laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened? For\n",
      "\n",
      "a moment I suspected that my intellect had tricked me. Then I noted\n",
      "\n",
      "the clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minute\n",
      "\n",
      "or so past ten; now it was nearly half-past three!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both\n",
      "\n",
      "hands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went\n",
      "\n",
      "dark. Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing\n",
      "\n",
      "me, towards the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to\n",
      "\n",
      "traverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room\n",
      "\n",
      "like a rocket. I pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The\n",
      "\n",
      "night came like the turning out of a lamp, and in another moment\n",
      "\n",
      "came to-morrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter\n",
      "\n",
      "and ever fainter. To-morrow night came black, then day again, night\n",
      "\n",
      "again, day again, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filled\n",
      "\n",
      "my ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time\n",
      "\n",
      "travelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling\n",
      "\n",
      "exactly like that one has upon a switchback--of a helpless headlong\n",
      "\n",
      "motion! I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent\n",
      "\n",
      "smash. As I put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a\n",
      "\n",
      "black wing. The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to\n",
      "\n",
      "fall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky,\n",
      "\n",
      "leaping it every minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed\n",
      "\n",
      "the laboratory had been destroyed and I had come into the open air.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too\n",
      "\n",
      "fast to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest snail that\n",
      "\n",
      "ever crawled dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling succession of\n",
      "\n",
      "darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then, in the\n",
      "\n",
      "intermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her\n",
      "\n",
      "quarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling\n",
      "\n",
      "stars. Presently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, the\n",
      "\n",
      "palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness;\n",
      "\n",
      "the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminous\n",
      "\n",
      "color like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak\n",
      "\n",
      "of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter fluctuating\n",
      "\n",
      "band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and then a\n",
      "\n",
      "brighter circle flickering in the blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hill-side\n",
      "\n",
      "upon which this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me\n",
      "\n",
      "grey and dim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour,\n",
      "\n",
      "now brown, now green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole surface of the earth seemed changed--melting and flowing\n",
      "\n",
      "under my eyes. The little hands upon the dials that registered my\n",
      "\n",
      "speed raced round faster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun\n",
      "\n",
      "belt swayed up and down, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or\n",
      "\n",
      "less, and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute; and\n",
      "\n",
      "minute by minute the white snow flashed across the world, and\n",
      "\n",
      "vanished, and was followed by the bright, brief green of spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They\n",
      "\n",
      "merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked\n",
      "\n",
      "indeed a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to\n",
      "\n",
      "account. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a\n",
      "\n",
      "kind of madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At\n",
      "\n",
      "first I scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but\n",
      "\n",
      "these new sensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions\n",
      "\n",
      "grew up in my mind--a certain curiosity and therewith a certain\n",
      "\n",
      "dread--until at last they took complete possession of me. What\n",
      "\n",
      "strange developments of humanity, what wonderful advances upon our\n",
      "\n",
      "rudimentary civilization, I thought, might not appear when I came to\n",
      "\n",
      "look nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated\n",
      "\n",
      "before my eyes! I saw great and splendid architecture rising about\n",
      "\n",
      "me, more massive than any buildings of our own time, and yet, as it\n",
      "\n",
      "seemed, built of glimmer and mist. I saw a richer green flow up the\n",
      "\n",
      "hill-side, and remain there, without any wintry intermission. Even\n",
      "\n",
      "through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair. And so\n",
      "\n",
      "my mind came round to the business of stopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some\n",
      "\n",
      "substance in the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long\n",
      "\n",
      "as I travelled at a high velocity through time, this scarcely\n",
      "\n",
      "mattered; I was, so to speak, attenuated--was slipping like a vapour\n",
      "\n",
      "through the interstices of intervening substances! But to come to\n",
      "\n",
      "a stop involved the jamming of myself, molecule by molecule, into\n",
      "\n",
      "whatever lay in my way; meant bringing my atoms into such intimate\n",
      "\n",
      "contact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical\n",
      "\n",
      "reaction--possibly a far-reaching explosion--would result, and blow\n",
      "\n",
      "myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions--into the\n",
      "\n",
      "Unknown. This possibility had occurred to me again and again while I\n",
      "\n",
      "was making the machine; but then I had cheerfully accepted it as an\n",
      "\n",
      "unavoidable risk--one of the risks a man has got to take! Now the\n",
      "\n",
      "risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the same cheerful light.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact is that, insensibly, the absolute strangeness of everything,\n",
      "\n",
      "the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above all, the\n",
      "\n",
      "feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerve. I told\n",
      "\n",
      "myself that I could never stop, and with a gust of petulance I\n",
      "\n",
      "resolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I lugged over\n",
      "\n",
      "the lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over, and I was\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "and I was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything still seemed grey, but presently I remarked that the\n",
      "\n",
      "confusion in my ears was gone. I looked round me. I was on what\n",
      "\n",
      "seemed to be a little lawn in a garden, surrounded by rhododendron\n",
      "\n",
      "bushes, and I noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were\n",
      "\n",
      "dropping in a shower under the beating of the hail-stones. The\n",
      "\n",
      "rebounding, dancing hail hung in a cloud over the machine, and drove\n",
      "\n",
      "along the ground like smoke. In a moment I was wet to the skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fine hospitality,\" said I, \"to a man who has travelled innumerable\n",

      "\n",

      "stone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy\n",
      "\n",
      "downpour. But all else of the world was invisible.\n",

      "\n",
      "marble, in shape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings,\n",
      "\n",
      "instead of being carried vertically at the sides, were spread so\n",
      "\n",
      "that it seemed to hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of\n",

      "bronze, and was thick with verdigris. It chanced that the face was\n",
      "\n",
      "towards me; the sightless eyes seemed to watch me; there was the\n",
      "\n",
      "faint shadow of a smile on the lips. It was greatly weather-worn,\n",
      "\n",
      "and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease. I stood\n",

      "developed into something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly\n",
      "\n",
      "powerful? I might seem some old-world savage animal, only the more\n",

      "dreadful and disgusting for our common likeness--a foul creature to\n",

      "fear. I turned frantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "of the summer sky, some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into\n",
      "\n",
      "nothingness. The great buildings about me stood out clear and\n",
      "\n",
      "distinct, shining with the wet of the thunderstorm, and picked out\n",
      "\n",
      "in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses. I\n",
      "\n",
      "felt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps a bird may feel in\n",
      "\n",
      "the clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop. My fear\n",
      "\n",
      "grew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth, and again\n",
      "\n",
      "grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave under\n",
      "\n",
      "my desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently. One\n",

      "in attitude to mount again.\n",

      "\n",
      "leather belt. Sandals or buskins--I could not clearly distinguish\n",
      "\n",
      "which--were on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his\n",

      "eyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at\n",
      "\n",
      "once. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and\n",

      "\n",
      "addressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was\n",
      "\n",
      "too harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my\n",
      "\n",
      "ears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then\n",
      "\n",
      "touched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my\n",
      "\n",
      "back and shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was\n",
      "\n",
      "nothing in this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in\n",
      "\n",
      "these pretty little people that inspired confidence--a graceful\n",
      "\n",
      "gentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides, they looked so\n",
      "\n",
      "frail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them\n",
      "\n",
      "about like nine-pins. But I made a sudden motion to warn them when I\n",

      "forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed the\n",
      "\n",
      "little levers that would set it in motion, and put these in my\n",

      "communication.\n",

      "\n",
      "neck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the\n",
      "\n",
      "face, and their ears were singularly minute. The mouths were small,\n",
      "\n",
      "with bright red, rather thin lips, and the little chins ran to a\n",
      "\n",
      "point. The eyes were large and mild; and--this may seem egotism on\n",

      "\n",
      "You see I had always anticipated that the people of the year Eight\n",
      "\n",
      "Hundred and Two Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in\n",
      "\n",
      "knowledge, art, everything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a\n",
      "\n",
      "question that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of\n",
      "\n",
      "our five-year-old children--asked me, in fact, if I had come from\n",
      "\n",
      "the sun in a thunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended\n",
      "\n",
      "upon their clothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features.\n",
      "\n",
      "A flow of disappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I felt\n",

      "\n",
      "of a thunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so\n",
      "\n",
      "and bowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of\n",
      "\n",
      "beautiful flowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea was received with melodious applause; and presently they\n",
      "\n",
      "were all running to and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging\n",
      "\n",
      "them upon me until I was almost smothered with blossom. You who\n",
      "\n",
      "have never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and\n",

      "wonderful flowers countless years of culture had created. Then\n",
      "\n",
      "someone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the\n",

      "nearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx of white marble,\n",
      "\n",
      "which had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my\n",
      "\n",
      "astonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone. As I\n",

      "\n",
      "shadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw\n",
      "\n",
      "over their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and\n",

      "\n",
      "light. The floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "channelled along the more frequented ways. Transverse to the length\n",

      "\n",
      "the corner of the marble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless,\n",
      "\n",
      "the general effect was extremely rich and picturesque. There were,\n",

      "perhaps, a couple of hundred people dining in the hall, and most of\n",
      "\n",
      "them, seated as near to me as they could come, were watching me with\n",

      "\n",
      "convenient thing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began\n",
      "\n",
      "a series of interrogative sounds and gestures. I had some\n",
      "\n",
      "considerable difficulty in conveying my meaning. At first my efforts\n",

      "\n",
      "of amusement. However, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children,\n",
      "\n",
      "and persisted, and presently I had a score of noun substantives at\n",
      "\n",
      "least at my command; and then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and\n",
      "\n",
      "even the verb \"to eat.\" But it was slow work, and the little people\n",
      "\n",
      "soon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations, so I\n",

      "I perceived that all had the same form of costume, the same soft\n",

      "\n",
      "strange, perhaps, that I had not noticed this before. But everything\n",
      "\n",
      "was so strange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, and\n",
      "\n",
      "in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the\n",

      "\n",
      "the children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their\n",
      "\n",
      "parents. I judged, then, that the children of that time were\n",
      "\n",
      "extremely precocious, physically at least, and I found afterwards\n",
      "\n",
      "abundant verification of my opinion.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "one would expect; for the strength of a man and the softness of a\n",
      "\n",
      "woman, the institution of the family, and the differentiation of\n",
      "\n",
      "occupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical\n",
      "\n",
      "force; where population is balanced and abundant, much childbearing\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "violently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx,\n",
      "\n",
      "and startling some white animal that, in the dim light, I took for a\n",
      "\n",
      "small deer. I remember, too, late that night, beating the bushes\n",
      "\n",
      "with my clenched fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding\n",
      "\n",
      "from the broken twigs. Then, sobbing and raving in my anguish of\n",
      "\n",
      "mind, I went down to the great building of stone. The big hall was\n",
      "\n",
      "dark, silent, and deserted. I slipped on the uneven floor, and fell\n",
      "\n",
      "over one of the malachite tables, almost breaking my shin. I lit a\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "suddenly out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the\n",
      "\n",
      "splutter and flare of a match. For they had forgotten about matches.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is my Time Machine?\" I began, bawling like an angry child,\n",
      "\n",
      "laying hands upon them and shaking them up together. It must have\n",
      "\n",
      "been very queer to them. Some laughed, most of them looked sorely\n",
      "\n",
      "frightened. When I saw them standing round me, it came into my head\n",
      "\n",
      "that I was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do\n",
      "\n",
      "under the circumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "For, reasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought that fear\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "out under the moonlight. I heard cries of terror and their little\n",

      "\n",
      "I did as the moon crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected\n",
      "\n",
      "nature of my loss that maddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from\n",
      "\n",
      "my own kind--a strange animal in an unknown world. I must have raved\n",
      "\n",
      "to and fro, screaming and crying upon God and Fate. I have a memory\n",
      "\n",
      "of horrible fatigue, as the long night of despair wore away; of\n",
      "\n",
      "looking in this impossible place and that; of groping among moon-lit\n",
      "\n",
      "ruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows; at last,\n",
      "\n",
      "of lying on the ground near the sphinx and weeping with absolute\n",
      "\n",
      "wretchedness. I had nothing left but misery. Then I slept, and when\n",
      "\n",
      "I woke again it was full day, and a couple of sparrows were hopping\n",
      "\n",
      "round me on the turf within reach of my arm.\n",

      "\n",
      "I had got there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion\n",
      "\n",
      "and despair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain,\n",
      "\n",
      "reasonable daylight, I could look my circumstances fairly in the\n",
      "\n",
      "face. I saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could\n",
      "\n",
      "reason with myself. \"Suppose the worst?\" I said. \"Suppose the\n",
      "\n",
      "machine altogether lost--perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be\n",
      "\n",
      "calm and patient, to learn the way of the people, to get a clear\n",
      "\n",
      "idea of the method of my loss, and the means of getting materials\n",
      "\n",
      "and tools; so that in the end, perhaps, I may make another.\" That\n",
      "\n",
      "would be my only hope, perhaps, but better than despair. And, after\n",
      "\n",
      "all, it was a beautiful and curious world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'But probably, the machine had only been taken away. Still, I must\n",
      "\n",
      "be calm and patient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force\n",
      "\n",
      "or cunning. And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about\n",
      "\n",
      "me, wondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, and\n",
      "\n",
      "travel-soiled. The freshness of the morning made me desire an equal\n",
      "\n",
      "freshness. I had exhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went about\n",
      "\n",
      "my business, I found myself wondering at my intense excitement\n",
      "\n",
      "overnight. I made a careful examination of the ground about the\n",
      "\n",
      "little lawn. I wasted some time in futile questionings, conveyed, as\n",
      "\n",
      "well as I was able, to such of the little people as came by. They\n",
      "\n",
      "all failed to understand my gestures; some were simply stolid, some\n",
      "\n",
      "thought it was a jest and laughed at me. I had the hardest task in\n",
      "\n",
      "the world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces. It was\n",
      "\n",
      "a foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger\n",
      "\n",
      "was ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The turf gave better counsel. I found a groove ripped in it, about\n",
      "\n",
      "midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet\n",
      "\n",
      "where, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow\n",
      "\n",
      "footprints like those I could imagine made by a sloth. This directed\n",
      "\n",
      "my closer attention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have said,\n",
      "\n",
      "of bronze. It was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deep\n",
      "\n",
      "framed panels on either side. I went and rapped at these. The\n",
      "\n",
      "pedestal was hollow. Examining the panels with care I found them\n",
      "\n",
      "discontinuous with the frames. There were no handles or keyholes,\n",
      "\n",
      "but possibly the panels, if they were doors, as I supposed, opened\n",
      "\n",
      "from within. One thing was clear enough to my mind. It took no very\n",
      "\n",
      "great mental effort to infer that my Time Machine was inside that\n",
      "\n",
      "pedestal. But how it got there was a different problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes\n",
      "\n",
      "and under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned\n",
      "\n",
      "smiling to them and beckoned them to me. They came, and then,\n",
      "\n",
      "pointing to the bronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open\n",
      "\n",
      "it. But at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I\n",
      "\n",
      "don't know how to convey their expression to you. Suppose you were\n",
      "\n",
      "to use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman--it is\n",
      "\n",
      "how she would look. They went off as if they had received the last\n",
      "\n",
      "possible insult. I tried a sweet-looking little chap in white next,\n",
      "\n",
      "with exactly the same result. Somehow, his manner made me feel\n",
      "\n",
      "ashamed of myself. But, as you know, I wanted the Time Machine, and\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried him once more. As he turned off, like the others, my temper\n",
      "\n",
      "got the better of me. In three strides I was after him, had him by\n",
      "\n",
      "the loose part of his robe round the neck, and began dragging him\n",
      "\n",
      "towards the sphinx. Then I saw the horror and repugnance of his\n",
      "\n",
      "face, and all of a sudden I let him go.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I thought I heard a sound like a chuckle--but I must have been\n",
      "\n",
      "mistaken. Then I got a big pebble from the river, and came and\n",
      "\n",
      "hammered till I had flattened a coil in the decorations, and the\n",
      "\n",
      "verdigris came off in powdery flakes. The delicate little people\n",
      "\n",
      "must have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on\n",
      "\n",
      "either hand, but nothing came of it. I saw a crowd of them upon the\n",
      "\n",
      "slopes, looking furtively at me. At last, hot and tired, I sat down\n",
      "\n",
      "to watch the place. But I was too restless to watch long; I am too\n",
      "\n",
      "Occidental for a long vigil. I could work at a problem for years,\n",
      "\n",
      "but to wait inactive for twenty-four hours--that is another matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the\n",
      "\n",
      "bushes towards the hill again. \"Patience,\" said I to myself. \"If you\n",
      "\n",
      "want your machine again you must leave that sphinx alone. If they\n",
      "\n",
      "mean to take your machine away, it's little good your wrecking their\n",
      "\n",
      "bronze panels, and if they don't, you will get it back as soon as\n",
      "\n",
      "you can ask for it. To sit among all those unknown things before a\n",
      "\n",
      "puzzle like that is hopeless. That way lies monomania. Face this\n",
      "\n",
      "world. Learn its ways, watch it, be careful of too hasty guesses\n",
      "\n",
      "at its meaning. In the end you will find clues to it all.\" Then\n",
      "\n",
      "suddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind: the thought\n",
      "\n",
      "of the years I had spent in study and toil to get into the future\n",
      "\n",
      "age, and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it. I had made\n",
      "\n",
      "myself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a\n",
      "\n",
      "man devised. Although it was at my own expense, I could not help\n",
      "\n",
      "myself. I laughed aloud.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little\n",
      "\n",
      "people avoided me. It may have been my fancy, or it may have had\n",
      "\n",
      "something to do with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felt\n",
      "\n",
      "tolerably sure of the avoidance. I was careful, however, to show no\n",
      "\n",
      "concern and to abstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course\n",
      "\n",
      "of a day or two things got back to the old footing. I made what\n",
      "\n",
      "progress I could in the language, and in addition I pushed my\n",
      "\n",
      "explorations here and there. Either I missed some subtle point or\n",
      "\n",
      "their language was excessively simple--almost exclusively composed\n",
      "\n",
      "of concrete substantives and verbs. There seemed to be few, if any,\n",
      "\n",
      "abstract terms, or little use of figurative language. Their\n",
      "\n",
      "sentences were usually simple and of two words, and I failed to\n",
      "\n",
      "convey or understand any but the simplest propositions. I determined\n",
      "\n",
      "to put the thought of my Time Machine and the mystery of the bronze\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "until my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a natural\n",
      "\n",
      "way. Yet a certain feeling, you may understand, tethered me in a\n",
      "\n",
      "circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant\n",
      "\n",
      "richness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the\n",
      "\n",
      "same abundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material\n",
      "\n",
      "and style, the same clustering thickets of evergreens, the same\n",
      "\n",
      "blossom-laden trees and tree-ferns. Here and there water shone like\n",
      "\n",
      "silver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and\n",
      "\n",
      "so faded into the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which\n",
      "\n",
      "presently attracted my attention, was the presence of certain\n",
      "\n",
      "circular wells, several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth.\n",
      "\n",
      "One lay by the path up the hill, which I had followed during my\n",
      "\n",
      "first walk. Like the others, it was rimmed with bronze, curiously\n",
      "\n",
      "wrought, and protected by a little cupola from the rain. Sitting by\n",
      "\n",
      "the side of these wells, and peering down into the shafted darkness,\n",
      "\n",
      "I could see no gleam of water, nor could I start any reflection\n",
      "\n",
      "with a lighted match. But in all of them I heard a certain sound:\n",
      "\n",
      "a thud--thud--thud, like the beating of some big engine; and I\n",
      "\n",
      "discovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady current of\n",
      "\n",
      "air set down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper into the\n",
      "\n",
      "throat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was at\n",

      "once sucked swiftly out of sight.\n",

      "\n",
      "often just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above\n",
      "\n",
      "a sun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached a strong\n",
      "\n",
      "suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "apprehend or believe? Then, think how narrow the gap between a negro\n",
      "\n",
      "and a white man of our own times, and how wide the interval between\n",
      "\n",
      "myself and these of the Golden Age! I was sensible of much which was\n",
      "\n",
      "unseen, and which contributed to my comfort; but save for a general\n",

      "from an exploration, and she received me with cries of delight and\n",
      "\n",
      "presented me with a big garland of flowers--evidently made for me\n",
      "\n",
      "and me alone. The thing took my imagination. Very possibly I had\n",

      "\n",
      "done. We passed each other flowers, and she kissed my hands. I did\n",
      "\n",
      "the same to hers. Then I tried talk, and found that her name was\n",
      "\n",
      "Weena, which, though I don't know what it meant, somehow seemed\n",
      "\n",
      "appropriate enough. That was the beginning of a queer friendship\n",

      "of the world had to be mastered. I had not, I said to myself, come\n",
      "\n",
      "into the future to carry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distress\n",
      "\n",
      "when I left her was very great, her expostulations at the parting\n",
      "\n",
      "were sometimes frantic, and I think, altogether, I had as much\n",

      "\n",
      "a very great comfort. I thought it was mere childish affection that\n",

      "\n",
      "what I had inflicted upon her when I left her. Nor until it was too\n",

      "oddest confidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I made\n",
      "\n",
      "threatening grimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. But she\n",
      "\n",
      "dreaded the dark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness\n",
      "\n",

      "houses after dark, and slept in droves. To enter upon them without a\n",

      "the last night of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm.\n",

      "\n",
      "colourless and clear cut, and yet unreal. I got up, and went down\n",
      "\n",
      "into the great hall, and so out upon the flagstones in front of the\n",

      "\n",

      "a solitary white, ape-like creature running rather quickly up the\n",

      "\n",
      "figures all the morning, until Weena's rescue drove them out of my\n",

      "pump below made me giddy. Then I felt sideways for the projecting\n",
      "\n",
      "hooks, and, as I did so, my feet were grasped from behind, and I\n",

      "\n",
      "struggle against this faintness. Several times my head swam, and I\n",

      "by some unknown forces which I had only to understand to overcome;\n",

      "incomprehensible remarks about the Dark Nights. It was not now\n",
      "\n",
      "such a very difficult problem to guess what the coming Dark Nights\n",
      "\n",

      "the dark. I wondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be that\n",

      "generations, had come at last to find the daylit surface\n",
      "\n",
      "intolerable. And the Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, and\n",
      "\n",
      "maintained them in their habitual needs, perhaps through the\n",
      "\n",
      "survival of an old habit of service. They did it as a standing horse\n",
      "\n",
      "paws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport:\n",
      "\n",
      "because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the\n",

      "against my shoulder. So we went down a long slope into a valley, and\n",

      "there in the dimness I almost walked into a little river. This I\n",

      "it, either to the right or the left. Feeling tired--my feet, in\n",
      "\n",
      "particular, were very sore--I carefully lowered Weena from my\n",

      "\n",
      "of yore. Southward (as I judged it) was a very bright red star that\n",

      "\n",
      "very clear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at\n",

      "\n",
      "sky, like the reflection of some colourless fire, and the old moon\n",
      "\n",
      "rose, thin and peaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking\n",

      "down a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall I had\n",
      "\n",
      "entered. Apparently this section had been devoted to natural\n",
      "\n",
      "history, but everything had long since passed out of recognition. A\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "ill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the\n",

      "big machines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some\n",
      "\n",
      "still fairly complete. You know I have a certain weakness for\n",
      "\n",
      "mechanism, and I was inclined to linger among these; the more so as\n",
      "\n",
      "for the most part they had the interest of puzzles, and I could make\n",
      "\n",
      "only the vaguest guesses at what they were for. I fancied that if\n",

      "you went down the length, the ground came up against these windows,\n",
      "\n",
      "until at last there was a pit like the \"area\" of a London house\n",
      "\n",
      "before each, and only a narrow line of daylight at the top. I went\n",
      "\n",
      "slowly along, puzzling about the machines, and had been too intent\n",

      "upon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light, until\n",

      "\n",
      "then, as I looked round me, I saw that the dust was less abundant\n",
      "\n",
      "and its surface less even. Further away towards the dimness, it\n",
      "\n",
      "appeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints. My\n",

      "afternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means\n",
      "\n",
      "of making a fire. And then down in the remote blackness of the\n",
      "\n",
      "gallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I had\n",

      "those in a signal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this\n",

      "lever in my hands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly\n",
      "\n",
      "Weena, deserted in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged\n",

      "the strength of the lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a\n",
      "\n",
      "minute's strain, and I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than\n",
      "\n",
      "sufficient, I judged, for any Morlock skull I might encounter. And I\n",
      "\n",
      "longed very much to kill a Morlock or so. Very inhuman, you may\n",
      "\n",
      "think, to want to go killing one's own descendants! But it was\n",
      "\n",
      "impossible, somehow, to feel any humanity in the things. Only my\n",
      "\n",
      "disinclination to leave Weena, and a persuasion that if I began to\n",

      "The brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I\n",

      "presently recognized as the decaying vestiges of books. They had\n",
      "\n",
      "long since dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had left\n",
      "\n",
      "them. But here and there were warped boards and cracked metallic\n",
      "\n",
      "clasps that told the tale well enough. Had I been a literary man I\n",
      "\n",
      "might, perhaps, have moralized upon the futility of all ambition.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as it was, the thing that struck me with keenest force was the\n",
      "\n",
      "enormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rotting\n",
      "\n",
      "paper testified. At the time I will confess that I thought chiefly\n",

      "hope of useful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof had\n",
      "\n",
      "collapsed, this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every\n",
      "\n",
      "unbroken case. And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases,\n",
      "\n",
      "I found a box of matches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were\n",

      "museum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to Weena's huge\n",
      "\n",
      "delight, I solemnly performed a kind of composite dance, whistling\n",

      "_The Land of the Leal_ as cheerfully as I could. In part it was a\n",
      "\n",
      "modest _cancan_, in part a step dance, in part a skirt-dance (so far\n",

      "the wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange, as for\n",
      "\n",
      "me it was a most fortunate thing. Yet, oddly enough, I found a far\n",
      "\n",
      "unlikelier substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed\n",
      "\n",
      "jar, that by chance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I fancied at first that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass\n",
      "\n",
      "accordingly. But the odour of camphor was unmistakable. In the\n",
      "\n",
      "universal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive,\n",
      "\n",
      "perhaps through many thousands of centuries. It reminded me of a\n",

      "\n",
      "Belemnite that must have perished and become fossilized millions\n",

      "of years ago. I was about to throw it away, but I remembered that\n",
      "\n",
      "it was inflammable and burned with a good bright flame--was, in\n",
      "\n",
      "fact, an excellent candle--and I put it in my pocket. I found no\n",
      "\n",
      "explosives, however, nor any means of breaking down the bronze\n",
      "\n",
      "doors. As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I had\n",

      "arms, and how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a\n",
      "\n",
      "sword. I could not carry both, however, and my bar of iron promised\n",
      "\n",
      "best against the bronze gates. There were numbers of guns, pistols,\n",
      "\n",
      "and rifles. The most were masses of rust, but many were of some\n",
      "\n",
      "new metal, and still fairly sound. But any cartridges or powder\n",
      "\n",
      "there may once have been had rotted into dust. One corner I saw was\n",
      "\n",
      "charred and shattered; perhaps, I thought, by an explosion among the\n",

      "'We emerged from the palace while the sun was still in part above\n",
      "\n",
      "the horizon. I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the\n",
      "\n",
      "next morning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods\n",
      "\n",
      "that had stopped me on the previous journey. My plan was to go as\n",
      "\n",
      "far as possible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep\n",
      "\n",
      "in the protection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I\n",
      "\n",
      "gathered any sticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my arms\n",
      "\n",
      "full of such litter. Thus loaded, our progress was slower than I had\n",
      "\n",
      "anticipated, and besides Weena was tired. And I began to suffer from\n",
      "\n",
      "sleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the\n",
      "\n",
      "wood. Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped,\n",
      "\n",
      "fearing the darkness before us; but a singular sense of impending\n",
      "\n",
      "calamity, that should indeed have served me as a warning, drove me\n",
      "\n",
      "onward. I had been without sleep for a night and two days, and I was\n",
      "\n",
      "feverish and irritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the\n",
      "\n",
      "Morlocks with it.\n",

      "\n",
      "'While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim\n",
      "\n",
      "against their blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was\n",
      "\n",
      "scrub and long grass all about us, and I did not feel safe from\n",
      "\n",
      "their insidious approach. The forest, I calculated, was rather\n",
      "\n",
      "less than a mile across. If we could get through it to the bare\n",
      "\n",
      "hill-side, there, as it seemed to me, was an altogether safer\n",
      "\n",
      "resting-place; I thought that with my matches and my camphor I could\n",
      "\n",
      "contrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods. Yet it was\n",
      "\n",
      "evident that if I was to flourish matches with my hands I should\n",
      "\n",
      "have to abandon my firewood; so, rather reluctantly, I put it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then it came into my head that I would amaze our friends behind\n",
      "\n",
      "by lighting it. I was to discover the atrocious folly of this\n",
      "\n",
      "proceeding, but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for covering\n",

      "our retreat.\n",

      "'I don't know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must\n",
      "\n",
      "be in the absence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun's\n",
      "\n",
      "heat is rarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused by\n",
      "\n",
      "dewdrops, as is sometimes the case in more tropical districts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lightning may blast and blacken, but it rarely gives rise to\n",
      "\n",
      "widespread fire. Decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with\n",
      "\n",
      "the heat of its fermentation, but this rarely results in flame. In\n",
      "\n",
      "this decadence, too, the art of fire-making had been forgotten on\n",
      "\n",
      "the earth. The red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood were\n",

      "\n",
      "and in spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the\n",
      "\n",
      "wood. For a little way the glare of my fire lit the path. Looking\n",
      "\n",
      "back presently, I could see, through the crowded stems, that from my\n",
      "\n",
      "heap of sticks the blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent, and a\n",
      "\n",
      "curved line of fire was creeping up the grass of the hill. I laughed\n",
      "\n",
      "at that, and turned again to the dark trees before me. It was very\n",
      "\n",
      "black, and Weena clung to me convulsively, but there was still, as\n",
      "\n",
      "my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, sufficient light for me to\n",
      "\n",
      "avoid the stems. Overhead it was simply black, except where a gap of\n",
      "\n",
      "remote blue sky shone down upon us here and there. I struck none of\n",
      "\n",
      "my matches because I had no hand free. Upon my left arm I carried my\n",
      "\n",
      "little one, in my right hand I had my iron bar.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "the faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the\n",
      "\n",
      "throb of the blood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of a\n",
      "\n",
      "pattering about me. I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew more\n",
      "\n",
      "distinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I had\n",
      "\n",
      "heard in the Under-world. There were evidently several of the\n",
      "\n",
      "Morlocks, and they were closing in upon me. Indeed, in another\n",
      "\n",
      "minute I felt a tug at my coat, then something at my arm. And Weena\n",
      "\n",
      "shivered violently, and became quite still.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did\n",
      "\n",
      "so, and, as I fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the\n",
      "\n",
      "darkness about my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the\n",
      "\n",
      "same peculiar cooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands,\n",
      "\n",
      "too, were creeping over my coat and back, touching even my neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the match scratched and fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the\n",
      "\n",
      "white backs of the Morlocks in flight amid the trees. I hastily took\n",
      "\n",
      "a lump of camphor from my pocket, and prepared to light it as soon\n",
      "\n",
      "as the match should wane. Then I looked at Weena. She was lying\n",
      "\n",
      "clutching my feet and quite motionless, with her face to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a sudden fright I stooped to her. She seemed scarcely to\n",
      "\n",
      "breathe. I lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground,\n",
      "\n",
      "and as it split and flared up and drove back the Morlocks and the\n",
      "\n",
      "shadows, I knelt down and lifted her. The wood behind seemed full of\n",
      "\n",
      "the stir and murmur of a great company!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'She seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder\n",
      "\n",
      "and rose to push on, and then there came a horrible realization. In\n",
      "\n",
      "manoeuvring with my matches and Weena, I had turned myself about\n",
      "\n",
      "several times, and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction\n",
      "\n",
      "lay my path. For all I knew, I might be facing back towards the\n",
      "\n",
      "Palace of Green Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to\n",
      "\n",
      "think rapidly what to do. I determined to build a fire and encamp\n",
      "\n",
      "where we were. I put Weena, still motionless, down upon a turfy\n",
      "\n",
      "bole, and very hastily, as my first lump of camphor waned, I began\n",
      "\n",
      "collecting sticks and leaves. Here and there out of the darkness\n",
      "\n",
      "round me the Morlocks' eyes shone like carbuncles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'The camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so,\n",
      "\n",
      "two white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away.\n",
      "\n",
      "One was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and I\n",
      "\n",
      "felt his bones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop of\n",
      "\n",
      "dismay, staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece\n",
      "\n",
      "of camphor, and went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed\n",
      "\n",
      "how dry was some of the foliage above me, for since my arrival\n",
      "\n",
      "on the Time Machine, a matter of a week, no rain had fallen. So,\n",
      "\n",
      "instead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs, I began\n",
      "\n",
      "leaping up and dragging down branches. Very soon I had a choking\n",
      "\n",
      "smoky fire of green wood and dry sticks, and could economize my\n",
      "\n",
      "camphor. Then I turned to where Weena lay beside my iron mace. I\n",
      "\n",
      "tried what I could to revive her, but she lay like one dead. I could\n",
      "\n",
      "not even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have\n",
      "\n",
      "made me heavy of a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in\n",
      "\n",
      "the air. My fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. I\n",
      "\n",
      "felt very weary after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was\n",
      "\n",
      "full of a slumbrous murmur that I did not understand. I seemed just\n",
      "\n",
      "to nod and open my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had\n",
      "\n",
      "their hands upon me. Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily\n",
      "\n",
      "felt in my pocket for the match-box, and--it had gone! Then they\n",
      "\n",
      "gripped and closed with me again. In a moment I knew what had\n",
      "\n",
      "happened. I had slept, and my fire had gone out, and the bitterness\n",
      "\n",
      "of death came over my soul. The forest seemed full of the smell of\n",
      "\n",
      "burning wood. I was caught by the neck, by the hair, by the arms,\n",
      "\n",
      "and pulled down. It was indescribably horrible in the darkness to\n",
      "\n",
      "feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt as if I was in\n",
      "\n",
      "a monstrous spider's web. I was overpowered, and went down. I felt\n",
      "\n",
      "little teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I did so my\n",
      "\n",
      "hand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I struggled\n",
      "\n",
      "up, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar short,\n",
      "\n",
      "I thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could feel the\n",
      "\n",
      "succulent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, and for a moment\n",
      "\n",
      "I was free.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard\n",
      "\n",
      "fighting came upon me. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I\n",
      "\n",
      "determined to make the Morlocks pay for their meat. I stood with my\n",
      "\n",
      "back to a tree, swinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood was\n",
      "\n",
      "full of the stir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices\n",
      "\n",
      "seemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement, and their movements\n",
      "\n",
      "grew faster. Yet none came within reach. I stood glaring at the\n",
      "\n",
      "blackness. Then suddenly came hope. What if the Morlocks were\n",
      "\n",
      "afraid? And close on the heels of that came a strange thing. The\n",
      "\n",
      "darkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly I began to see the\n",
      "\n",
      "Morlocks about me--three battered at my feet--and then I recognized,\n",
      "\n",
      "with incredulous surprise, that the others were running, in an\n",
      "\n",
      "incessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through the\n",
      "\n",
      "wood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap\n",
      "\n",
      "of starlight between the branches, and vanish. And at that I\n",
      "\n",
      "understood the smell of burning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was\n",
      "\n",
      "growing now into a gusty roar, the red glow, and the Morlocks'\n",
      "\n",
      "flight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through\n",
      "\n",
      "the black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning\n",
      "\n",
      "forest. It was my first fire coming after me. With that I looked for\n",
      "\n",
      "Weena, but she was gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the\n",
      "\n",
      "explosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame, left little\n",
      "\n",
      "time for reflection. My iron bar still gripped, I followed in the\n",
      "\n",
      "Morlocks' path. It was a close race. Once the flames crept forward\n",
      "\n",
      "so swiftly on my right as I ran that I was outflanked and had to\n",
      "\n",
      "strike off to the left. But at last I emerged upon a small open\n",
      "\n",
      "space, and as I did so, a Morlock came blundering towards me, and\n",
      "\n",
      "past me, and went on straight into the fire!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of\n",
      "\n",
      "all that I beheld in that future age. This whole space was as bright\n",
      "\n",
      "as day with the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock\n",
      "\n",
      "or tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this was\n",
      "\n",
      "another arm of the burning forest, with yellow tongues already\n",
      "\n",
      "writhing from it, completely encircling the space with a fence of\n",
      "\n",
      "fire. Upon the hill-side were some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled\n",
      "\n",
      "by the light and heat, and blundering hither and thither against\n",
      "\n",
      "each other in their bewilderment. At first I did not realize their\n",

      "blindness, and struck furiously at them with my bar, in a frenzy of\n",
      "\n",
      "fear, as they approached me, killing one and crippling several more.\n",

      "But when I had watched the gestures of one of them groping under the\n",

      "making uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat\n",

      "\n",
      "blackness that was creeping over the day, and then I realized that\n",
      "\n",
      "an eclipse was beginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was\n",
      "\n",
      "passing across the sun's disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be\n",

      "\n",
      "trailed down from it; it seemed black against the weltering\n",
      "\n",
      "blood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then I felt I\n",

      "\n",
      "greater freedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and\n",

      "flowed. The hands spun backward upon the dials. At last I saw again\n",
      "\n",
      "the dim shadows of houses, the evidences of decadent humanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "These, too, changed and passed, and others came. Presently, when the\n",

      "off the thing very shakily, and sat down upon my bench. For several\n",

      "\n",
      "stillness. Then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the\n",

      "carpet. I took my eyes off the Time Traveller's face, and looked\n",
      "\n",
      "round at his audience. They were in the dark, and little spots of\n",
      "\n",
      "colour swam before them. The Medical Man seemed absorbed in the\n",

      "\n",
      "The Time Traveller put his hand to his head. He spoke like one who\n",
      "\n",
      "was trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him. 'They were put\n",
      "\n",
      "into my pocket by Weena, when I travelled into Time.' He stared\n",
      "\n",
      "round the room. 'I'm damned if it isn't all going. This room and you\n",
      "\n",
      "and the atmosphere of every day is too much for my memory. Did I\n",
      "\n",
      "ever make a Time Machine, or a model of a Time Machine? Or is it all\n",
      "\n",
      "only a dream? They say life is a dream, a precious poor dream at\n",
      "\n",
      "times--but I can't stand another that won't fit. It's madness. And\n",
      "\n",
      "where did the dream come from? ... I must look at that machine. If\n",
      "\n",
      "there is one!'\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through\n",
      "\n",
      "the door into the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickering\n",
      "\n",
      "light of the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and\n",
      "\n",
      "askew; a thing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering\n",
      "\n",
      "quartz. Solid to the touch--for I put out my hand and felt the rail\n",
      "\n",
      "of it--and with brown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of\n",
      "\n",
      "grass and moss upon the lower parts, and one rail bent awry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand\n",

      "along the damaged rail. 'It's all right now,' he said. 'The story I\n",
      "\n",
      "told you was true. I'm sorry to have brought you out here in the\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his\n",

      "coat. The Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certain\n",
      "\n",
      "hesitation, told him he was suffering from overwork, at which he\n",
      "\n",
      "laughed hugely. I remember him standing in the open doorway, bawling\n",

      "good night.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a 'gaudy lie.'\n",
      "\n",
      "For my own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story was\n",
      "\n",
      "so fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I\n",
      "\n",
      "lay awake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to go\n",
      "\n",
      "next day and see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the\n",
      "\n",
      "laboratory, and being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The laboratory, however, was empty. I stared for a minute at the\n",
      "\n",
      "Time Machine and put out my hand and touched the lever. At that the\n",
      "\n",
      "squat substantial-looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the\n",
      "\n",
      "wind. Its instability startled me extremely, and I had a queer\n",
      "\n",
      "reminiscence of the childish days when I used to be forbidden to\n",
      "\n",
      "meddle. I came back through the corridor. The Time Traveller met me\n",
      "\n",
      "in the smoking-room. He was coming from the house. He had a small\n",
      "\n",
      "camera under one arm and a knapsack under the other. He laughed when\n",
      "\n",
      "he saw me, and gave me an elbow to shake. 'I'm frightfully busy,'\n",
      "\n",
      "said he, 'with that thing in there.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'But is it not some hoax?' I said. 'Do you really travel through\n",
      "\n",
      "time?'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Really and truly I do.' And he looked frankly into my eyes. He\n",
      "\n",
      "hesitated. His eye wandered about the room. 'I only want half an\n",
      "\n",
      "hour,' he said. 'I know why you came, and it's awfully good of you.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's some magazines here. If you'll stop to lunch I'll prove you\n",
      "\n",
      "this time travelling up to the hilt, specimen and all. If you'll\n",
      "\n",
      "forgive my leaving you now?'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words,\n",
      "\n",
      "and he nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of\n",
      "\n",
      "the laboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily\n",
      "\n",
      "paper. What was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly\n",
      "\n",
      "I was reminded by an advertisement that I had promised to meet\n",
      "\n",
      "Richardson, the publisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw\n",
      "\n",
      "that I could barely save that engagement. I got up and went down the\n",
      "\n",
      "passage to tell the Time Traveller.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation,\n",
      "\n",
      "oddly truncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air\n",
      "\n",
      "whirled round me as I opened the door, and from within came the\n",
      "\n",
      "sound of broken glass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was\n",
      "\n",
      "not there. I seemed to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in\n",
      "\n",
      "a whirling mass of black and brass for a moment--a figure so\n",
      "\n",
      "transparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings was\n",
      "\n",
      "absolutely distinct; but this phantasm vanished as I rubbed my eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Time Machine had gone. Save for a subsiding stir of dust, the\n",
      "\n",
      "further end of the laboratory was empty. A pane of the skylight had,\n",
      "\n",
      "apparently, just been blown in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had\n",
      "\n",
      "happened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange\n",
      "\n",
      "thing might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened,\n",
      "\n",
      "and the man-servant appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. 'Has Mr. ----\n",
      "\n",
      "gone out that way?' said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
